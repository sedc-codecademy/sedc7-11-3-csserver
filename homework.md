# Homework

## Does favicon.ico requests annoy you as much as they annoy me?

- Do something about them :)

## Handle folder requests by providing an index file (in the `StaticResponseGenerator` plugin)

- Handle when an index.html file exists
- Handle when an index.html file does not exists (404)

## Make a gallery plugin

For a folder with multiple images, make a gallery pluging that will be constructed with the folder name. The gallery plugin should generate a html file that will contain

- The number of the images in the folder
- The total size of the images in the folder
- The images themselves

## Make a size footer

For all html files transfered from the server, add a div at the bottom that will contain the total size of the file in bytes (excluding the footer itself)
